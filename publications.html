      editorial="Quaternary Science Review 213, pp. 155-161. Editorial Elsevier"
      artAbstract="The basin of the Uruguay middle river has contributed important advances related to knowledge of the early settlement of southeastern South America.. This paper presents recent progress of the research on the Paleoamerican period that is being carried out in the Tigre site (Uruguay), where a cultural component with Fishtail points, bifaces, preforms and other artifacts dated at ~ 12,800 and 12,200 cal BP was found. The presence of silicified limestone (silcrete) in the Tigre site indicates mobility ranges of 190 e350 km to obtain this lithic resource. The data presented here allow to have an accurate discussion of the chronological period occupied by Fishtail groups on the plains of Uruguay; and to recognize the late stages of the Fishtail point manufacturing process used by these human groups, one of the most successful adaptations during the end of the Pleistocene in South America."

      editorial="Journal of Archaeological Science Reports 27: pp 1-12. Ed. Elsevier"
      artAbstract="Fishtail points are considered an indicator of the presence for one of the earliest and most successful human adaptations during the late Pleistocene in South America (~12,900-12,200 cal BP). Although these points display a wide range of variability both in size and shape, previous studies are mainly technological and descriptive observations. No efforts have been made to propose qualitative and quantitative indexes in order to understand how the rejuvenation/resharpening process may have affected the observed variability. In this paper, we explore different analytical methods to understand the rejuvenation process, explain the morphological variability of the Fishtail points and evaluate them from the perspectives of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics. This analysis allows us to generate new fresh interpretations and ideas about the rejuvenation of points. The combination of 2d geometric morphometrics, linear measurements, and multivariate regression, supports the hypothesis that the continuum of shape variation is explained by the long life history trajectories of the Fishtail points."

      artTitle="Living on the river edge: The Tigre site (K-87) new data and implications for the initial colonization of the Uruguay River basin"
      artAbstract='This paper presents new data on the initial settlement of the southeastern region of South America, based on recent research conducted at the Tigre archaeological site (K87), located in the middle Uruguay River basin, near the Uruguayan border with Brazil and Argentina. The current archaeological excavations carried out in this open-air site confirmed that it is a multicomponent site. A new series of 20 radio-carbon dates refined the chronology of recurrent human occupations at this site during the late Pleis-tocene (13,260 cal BP), the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (12,920e11,750 cal BP), the early Holocene (11,300e9300 cal BP), and the late Holocene (1180 cal BP), demonstrating the strategic importance of this site during the prehistory of the region. In this paper, we describe the archaeological and stratigraphic contexts of the site, and analyze the artifact assemblage of the early components. Tigre points recovered from the archaeological excavations confirm that this is a Paleoamerican point design that circulated in the region between 12,000e11,100 cal BP. In addition, associated with these points, bifaces, fractured preforms and a type of asymmetric biface with a crescent/half moon shape were recovered. These " crescent artifacts " show a high standardization in form, size and knapping technique, which is described in this paper. Finally, we discuss the geographic distribution of the Tigre points, the blade technology present in the Uruguay River basin, the presence of prestige artifacts during the settlement, and the chronology of the " Umbu tradition " of southern Brazil in relation to the previous and recent data obtained in the Tigre site.'

      artAbstract="During the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, climatic, faunistic, and ecological changes could produce social readjustments and technological innovations in human populations that were exploring and colonizing the low southeastern plains of South America. In this paper, paleoecological and archaeological data are integrated to systematize and discuss different aspects of early human settlement in Uruguay and the south of Brazil. It is possible to recognize evidence of initial human dispersion by the region between ~14,000 and 13,100 cal BP (12,000 to 11,320 14C BP) during the late Pleistocene, when dry and cold climatic conditions prevailed in the region. Later, between 12,800 and 10,065 cal BP, a low plains Paleoamerican stemmed bifacial tradition emerged with three different techno-complexes, represented by Fishtail, Tigre, and Pay Paso projectile points. These groups were adapted to the grassland plains and characterized by the presence of wide-stemmed projectile points. The Fishtail point had been supplanted by the Tigre point, showing diversification in design of projectile points during the PleistoceneeHolocene transition. Approximately 12,000 to 11,200 cal BP in the middle Uruguay River, a social and technological reorganization occurred, along with the emergence of the Tigre techno-complex during post-Fishtail times. The advent of Tigre groups coincided with warmer and wetter climatic conditions, indicating the beginning of the Holocene. By 11,080e10,928 cal BP, new weaponry changes occurred in the region, including the production of the Pay Paso points, a regionally distinctive projectile-point style for the early Holocene. These aspects allow start discussions of cultural transmission, technological innovations and morphological variation in projectile point styles over the time and space. The field research developed over the past 15 years, in conjunction with the previous research conducted in southern Brazil, the relative high density of early sites with radiocarbon ages (n ¼ 22), and the chronological base (67 radiocarbon ages), allow to formulate an archaeological and behavioral model about the initial peopling of the Uruguayan and southern Brazil plains.">

      artLink="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272181721_The_Paleoamerican_Occupation_of_the_Plains_of_Uruguay_Technology_Adaptations_and_Mobility"
      artAbstract="This paper presents results of investigation of an early archaeological site in Uruguay, and considers its position on a regional scale. Pay Paso 1 is the first early site of Uruguay to yield both artifacts and faunal remains including records of Pleistocene fauna (Equus sp. and Glyptodon sp.) in a radiocarbon-dated stratigraphic context. From stratigraphic, chronological and archaeological observations, three cultural components for the Pleistocene-Holocene transition have been identified, together representing one of the most intensively AMS dated sites in South America. This solid chronological base allows the positioning of the peopling of Uruguay in the context of the early settlement of the surrounding region including northeastern Argentina and southern Brazil. The site is also remarkable because it yielded evidence of a blade technology at 12,802 cal yr BP, with numerous blades and a depleted blade core, which, together with the records from Laguna Canosa and K87 (Arroyo del Tigre), permit the definition of the Tigre and Pay Paso Paleoamerican cultural complexes. Tigre and Pay Paso bifacial points were produced in post- Fishtail times in the Low Plains, a vast open territory in Uruguay and southern Brazil.">

      artAbstract="The paper presents the location of 10 translucent agate quarries discovered in the Catalanes Nacientes Arapey Archaeological Region (RACNA), which defines a procurement zone of agate in northern Uruguay. This raw material is the second-most used lithic resource in early stratigraphic contexts dated by 14C in northwestern Uruguay, following silicified sandstone. The frequency distribution of translucent agate is analyzed in two early residential hunter-gatherer sites, Pay Paso 1 (11,000 to 8,500 B.P.), and site K87 (10,420 B.P.), and at Catalan Seco 1 (CS-), which is a quarry-workshop site. A strong chronological basis is presented for the Pay Paso 1 site, which includes 32 radiocarbon dates that allow recognition of three early cultural components and a blade lithic technology for the initial occupation of the 1 site (10,930–10,880 B.P.). The paper discusses the main ways of distributing the translucent agate during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, which are related to accessibility of the resource, lithic technology, territory, and mobility of early hunter-gatherers in the region. Movements were recorded between 140 and 170 km from residential sites to the procurement area of the agate.">

      artAbstract="AmericaResearch on the first Americans in northern Uruguay is a long-term projectthat started over 10 years ago. All Pleistocene and early-Holocene transitionsites documented so far in Uruguay are open-air sites. Recent field workconducted since 2008 by the research team of the Museum of Archaeologyand Natural Sciences of Salto led to the discovery of a series of caves (n = 5)and rockshelters (n = 4) with early human occupations among the rolling hillsof Cuchilla de Haedo. Additionally, surveys helped to identify an additional112 archaeological sites, including quarries for raw materials (silicified sand-stone and translucent agate), rock-art sites, and stone structures (cairns andstone circles). Between November 2009 and May 2010 test excavations wereconducted in three rockshelters (ZT-1, TN 1, TN9). In this paper we presentthe results obtained at the Zanja del Tigre 1 site (ZT-1) an overhang 6.75 mlong, 2.25 m wide, and 3.00 m high. In ZT-1 we excavated a 2.00-by-0.50-munit, which recovered 5,652 pieces of debitage and 43 formal tools (bifaces,projectile points, unifacial tools, and abraders). The two main raw materialsare local silicified sandstone (92%) and chalcedony-agate (5.4%). A very lowfrequency of raw material is silicified limestone (0.2%), whose source is over150 km from the site. Other raw materials are present (2.4%), such as quartz,jasper, opal, basalt, and unidentified. The test excavation reached a depth of0.47 m, then encountered a probable collapse of roof rock. Two charcoalsamples taken at a depth of 0.37–0.40 m were dated by AMS at 8770 ± 30(UGAMS 7459) and 8750 ± 30 RCYBP (UGAMS 7460), or approximately 9750CALYBP.

    Recientemente se definió la Región Arqueológica Catalanes Nacientes Arapey
    (RACNA) que se extiende por un corredor de aproximadamente 100 km de largo por 30
    km de ancho desde la desembocadura del arroyo Catalán Grande hasta las nacientes del
    Arroyo Sopas (Suárez 2010; 2011b), donde existe una alta densidad de sitios
    arqueológicos de diferentes periodos y hay que destacar la presencia de aleros y cuevas
    con ocupación temprana que alcanzan por lo menos los 10.000 años AP (Suárez et al.
    2011).
    En la investigación arqueológica que llevamos a cabo participan investigadores
    nacionales (Suárez y Piñeiro 2002, Suárez y Rinderknecht 2007) y extranjeros (Suárez y
    Gillam 2008; Suárez y Leigh 2010; Suárez y Bradley, 2011; Suárez y Miotti 2011). Es
    un proyecto interdisciplinario de largo alcance, iniciado hace más de 12 años. Entre los
    principales objetivos se buscamos integrar datos culturales, arqueológicos,
    paleoambientales y paleoecológicos en relación a la ocupación humana inicial de
    Uruguay, para la cual tenemos evidencia confiable y sólida que ronda los 13.000 años
    C14 cal. AP. Se ha tomado geográficamente la cuenca del río Cuareim y río Uruguay
    medio como objeto de estudio.
    En la cuenca baja del río Cuareim los principales datos obtenidos durante la
    investigación se obtuvieron del sitio Pay Paso 1. La investigación realizada permitió
    generar una amplia base de datos cronológica que supera las 30 edades de C14 realizadas
    por el método AMS de alta resolución –destacándose más de 20 que superan los 10.000
    años C14 de antigüedad-, (Suárez 2011b). Comenzamos a conocer las estrategias
    económicas de los cazadores-recolectores tempranos pues recuperamos asociación entre
    artefactos líticos manufacturados por humanos con fauna del Pleistoceno (Equus y
    Glyptodon) así como con fauna actual (Suárez, 2003b, 2004; Suárez y Rinderknecht
    2007). Se propusieron las condiciones paleoambientales y climáticas ligadas a la inicial
    ocupación humana del Norte del Uruguay y se avanzó en la variabilidad cultural y étnica presente en Uruguay durante la transición Pleistoceno Holoceno (Suárez 2011a),
    esto por señalar los aspectos arqueológicos más importantes.
    El objetivo de este trabajo es aportar elementos a la discusión sobre tres temas
    fundamentales en la investigación del poblamiento de América como son la extinción de
    la fauna del Pleistoceno (Borrero 2009, Miotti y Salemme 1999, 2005; Politis et al.
    1995, 2003), la tendencia económica que comienza a reconocerse para los cazadores
    tempranos en Uruguay y la generación de un conjunto de edades radiocarbónicas de alta
    resolución (Faught 2008; Steele y Politis 2009; Water y Staford, 2007), utilizada como
    herramienta fundamental para resolver problemas arqueológicos, estratigráficos y
    cronológicos de sitios tempranos. Estos temas no han sido abordados aún en las
    publicaciones referidas a las ocupaciones tempranas recientemente generadas en
    Uruguay (ver Flegenheimer et. al. 2003; Gascue et al. 2009; Inda et al. 2011; López et
    al., 2009, 2011; Meneghin, 2000, 2004, 2005, 2006; Nami, 2001a, 2001b, 2007, entre

Leigh➤➤➤➤➤Keywords: Fishtail, alluvium, UruguayThe Tres Árboles site (RN2-2b) is located in central Uruguay (32° 44′29.7″S56° 44′10.7″W) along arroyo Tres Árboles, where during a visit in May 2009 theauthors verified the context of artifacts in alluvial sediments of probable termi-nal-Pleistocene to early-Holocene age. The site location was referred to us by Mr.S. Bálsamo, a local collector, who had obtained from this site a Fishtail pointmade from chert of the Queguay Formation. This Fishtail point (Figure 1B) is65.7 mm long and 36.9 mm wide, with a 22.4-mm stem and a thickness of 8.4mm. It exhibits basal thinning by long overlapping parallel retouches. The pointis red and black with white spots. During the visit, two diagnostic artifacts werefound in situ at a depth of about 250–280 cm below the surface of an alluvialterrace tread within the eroding terrace scarp, including: (1) a biface in theinitial stage of reduction manufactured from chalcedony (Figure 1A), which wasthinned from a rounded pebble and exhibits one face totally with flake scars,whereas the opposite face exhibits about 40% cortex; and (2) a blade tool ofsilicified limestone (Figure 2C). Other artifacts, which were out of context andhad been washed out onto the sloping ground surface, include endscrapers,sidescrapers, and informal tools from flakes.(...)">

On this site we recovered two extinct species, Equus sp. (ancient horse) e Glyptodon sp. (giant armadillo), direct associated with lithic artifacts. Our results indicate that these extinct mammals lived in the beginning of the Holocene (9,600 – 9,100 years 14C BP), based on nine 14C age results obtained by AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) measurements. In this work, these results are compared with others in South America. Human adaptation, lithic technology, Pleistocene fauna extinction and climate change at the transition between Pleistocene-Holocene are also discussed.">

      artAbstract="The archaeology of the late Pleistocene in southeast SouthAmerica hasn’t attracted as many investigators as other re-gions of the continent, for example, Pampa and Patagonia, andconsequently isn’t as well known. Our relatively meager knowl-edge of this region, especially of Uruguay, can’t be blamed on apaucity of early occupations. Instead, the fault lies with flawedinvestigation strategies that aren’t designed to look for earlystratified archaeological sites.In 2000 our research team undertook a long-term investiga-tion of early human occupations in the Uruguay plains duringthe late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The team includesgeologist Gustavo Piñeiro and paleontologist Andrés Rinder-chneckt (both University of Sciences, Uruguay), MarioTrindade (Museo de Arqueología of Salto), and various avoca-tional and amateur archaeologists from the cities of BellaUnión and Paso de los Toros. Recently two North Americanscientists contributed their talents, Dr. Chris Gillam (Univer-sity of South Carolina) to develop a GIS database of earlyhuman occupations in Uruguay, Dr. David Leigh (University ofGeorgia) to initiate geoarchaeological studies on early sites indunes in central Uruguay. Our project is indebted to Dr. LauraMiotti (University of La Plata, Argentina) and Dr. Bruce Brad-ley (Exeter University, UK), whose expert advice oftensmooths rough patches of road we encounter in our investigation">

      artAbstract="Fishtail points were first recognized as tools of early hunter-gatherers of SouthAmerica with the stratigraphic excavations of J. Bird (1938) in Fell’s Cave.However, Fishtail points were previously reported at the end of the 19thcentury. Ameghino (1918, Plate 1, 42 [1880]) published one Fishtail fromPampa; and a pioneer of Uruguayan archaeology, J. H. Figueira (1892:210),published two Fishtail points recovered from surface sites on dunes in the areaof Valizas on the Atlantic coast.Bifacial Fishtail points have been registered widely in several countries ofSouth and Central America, but reports of unifacial Fishtail points are scarce.The term “unifacial” Fishtail point is used here in a wide sense, referring notstrictly to a point with flake scars on one face only, but also to one that maypresent a few flake scars on an opposite face. Generally a Fishtail point hasthinning on both faces; in all examples of the unifacial Fishtail class, however,at least one surface of the original flake blank remains essentially unmodified(Figure 1).Bell (1960) and Mayer-Oakes (1966, 1986) described Fishtail points fromthe El Inga site in highland Ecuador. Mayer-Oakes (1966:650–52) provided adetailed description of these artifacts; he discussed three points, having un-modified surfaces of the original flakes, that were used as blanks (1966:Figures 7b, 8b, 9b).In Uruguay, unifacial Fishtail points were first reported by Bosch et al.(1980: Figure 2-17). In the Argentinean Pampas, three examples have beenreported by Martínez (1997), Mazzanti (2003), Valverde (2003) andFlegenheimer et al. (2003).To date, I have recorded nine unifacial Fishtail points in Uruguay, in thebasins of the middle Río Negro and Río de la Plata, and on the Atlantic coast.They range in length from 35.2 to 63 mm, are manufactured on silicified(...)">

      artAbstract="In the past decade, the archaeology of the late Pleistocene and early Holocene
    in Uruguay has witnessed many new discoveries of early hunter-gatherers that
    parallel findings throughout the Americas. This transitional period is characterized by two early point types, Fishtail and Pay Paso. Fishtail, or Fell’s Cave,
    points occur with and without fluting and are widely distributed in Uruguay
    (Figure 1A) (Bosh et. al 1974; Suárez 2006). Pay Paso points from northwest
    and central Uruguay are a more recent type, have a triangular blade, welldefined stem with concave base, and bilateral basal thinning (Figure 1B)
    (Suárez 2003).
    A collections survey to further document site location and component
    information throughout the region is underway. To date, 46 sites with Fishtail
    or Pay Paso points, quarries of agate, silicified sandstone, silicified limestone,

      artAbstract="The fishtail point has a discontinuous distribution and dispersion pattern inSouth America (Borrero 1983). Some fishtail points have been recorded inCentral America and at the El Inga site in Ecuador (Bird and Cooke 1978;Mayer-Oakes 1986; Ranere and Cooke 1991). However, the pattern appearsmore frequently in the southern cone of South America, Pampa-Patagonia ofArgentina, the Uruguayan plains, central and southern Chile, and southernBrazil. Isolated fishtail points have also been recovered in Perú (Chauchat andZevallos 1979; Briceño 1999). Fishtail points have not yet been reported inColombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, the Amazon Basin, or the northernand central regions of Brazil.In Uruguay complete fishtail points range in size from 35 to 109 mm long,21 to 56.8 mm wide, and 5 to 11 mm thick; their weight ranges from 5.4 to 51.8g. Approximately 68 percent are not fluted, 24 percent are fluted on one faceof the stem, and only 8 percent are fluted on both faces of the stem.Based on the available information for Uruguay (n ~ 90 fishtail points), Isuggest at least three main lithic reduction sequences for making fishtailpoints by Paleoamerican knappers (Suárez 2003c). One technique includescomplete bifacial thinning from initial to final stages of reduction. In Uru-guay, this technique is illustrated by Suárez and López (2003:73, Figure 5).Additional early-stage bifaces, ranging from ca. 130 to 195 mm long, and otherfluted bifaces with some Paleoamerican technological features, includingnipple isolation and platform prepared by retouch and abrasion, have beenrecognized in Uruguay (Suárez 2002:318, Figure 3). Fishtail points madeusing complete bifacial thinning are relatively long and generally exhibitfluting and good spacing of flake scars. These points were likely used in lancesor hand-held spears. Another recognized reduction technique is bifacialthinning in the final stage of manufacture, similar to the one reported forsouthern Patagonia (Nami 2003). The last technique observed in somesamples starts with a thin flake and uses a unifacial method of manufacturewithout bifacial thinning">

This paper presents a synthesis and overview of the poorly known archaeology of the Pleistocene/Holocene transition of Uruguay, including archaeological, sedimentological and palaeontological information related to the early human occupation. In this region, the ancient human settlements occurred in various environmental settings including riverbanks, hilltops, and maritime landscapes. New Fell type or "fishtail" projectile points and preliminary results of the current research in Pay Paso locality are presented. Evidence from Pay Paso site 1 indicates that during Early Holocene, the shore of the Cuareim River was a paleosurface that was occupied by early human groups. A new and previously unpublished type of projectile point from early hunter-gatherers (ca. 9300-9100 yr BP) was recovered from excavation of Pay Paso site 1. Finally, some comments and observations about culture material and lithic technology for early people of Uruguay are explored.'>

      <p slot="book_resume">
        This edited volume, which emerged from a symposium organized at the 2014 SAA meeting in Austin, Texas, covers
        recent Paleoamerican research and site excavations from Patagonia to Canada. Contributors discuss the peopling
        of the Americas, early American assemblages, lifeways, and regional differences. Many scholars present current
        data previously unavailable in English. Chapters are organized south to north in an attempt to shake the usual
        north-centric focus of Pleistocene–Early Holocene archaeological studies and to bring to the forefront the
        many
        fascinating discoveries being made in southern latitudes. The diversity of approaches over a large geographic
        expanse generates discussion that prompts a re-evaluation of predominant paradigms about how the expansion of
        Homo sapiens in the Western Hemisphere took place. Those who work in Paleoamerican studies will embrace this
        book for its new data and for its comparative look at the Americas.

      </h3>
      <p slot="book_resume">
        Los sitios arqueológicos del arroyo Catalán Chico fueron descubiertos en el año 1955 por Antonio Taddei.
        Fueron
        referencia en la arqueología regional americana durante la década de 1960-1970. El presente libro analiza
        desde
        una perspectiva histórica-critica el conocimiento generado en la primera etapa de investigación de los sitios,
        llegando a la conclusión que estos sitios no pertenecen a un único grupo sociocultural o industria lítica como
        se sugiere el planteo clásico. Además en el libro se presentan los resultados de las investigaciones
        interdisciplinarias actuales iniciadas en el año 2000, que incluyen estudios geoarqueológicos, petrográficos
        (cortes de lámina delgada), estratigrafía y tecnología lítica relacionada con la producción de bifaces en los
        sitios. Los sitios arqueológicos del Catalán Chico forman parte de lo que se ha definido recientemente como la
        Región Arqueológica Catalanes Nacientes Arapey (RACNA), donde se han identificado centenares de sitios
        arqueológicos, canteras-talleres, afloramientos de ágata, arenisca silicificada, jaspe, ópalo y cristal de
        cuarzo entre otras. Hoy los sitios de la RACNA y en particular los del arroyo Catalán Chico están en serio
        riesgo de destrucción debido al avance de la minería en la zona, el libro dedica algunas hojas al tema en el
        capitulo Patrimonio y Arqueología. Por último, se presenta un modelo de movilidad para los cazadores
        tempranos,
        donde se han identificado desplazamientos que incluyen traslados de los cazadores-recolectores a distancias de
        entre 140-170 km desde los sitios residenciales Paleoindios del río Uruguay medio y río Cuareim inferior,
        hasta
        la zona de afloramientos de recursos líticos de la RACNA en busca de ágata traslúcida, roca que por motivos
        culturales, sociales y/o simbólicos era utilizada por los primeros humanos que exploraron y colonizaron el
        norte
        de Uruguay hace 13.000 años.
